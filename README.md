# Leaseweb :: PHP Technical Assignment - Customer Portal - FRONTEND

Hello dear developers, this is the frontend code of the assignment for the Full Stack PHP position. I know you guys are using Angular, which I don't have experience with (yet!), so I did it using ReactJS + TypeScript to demo some front skills with JavaScript and TypeScript.
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:marcostimm/leaseweb-backend.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd leaseweb
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Run (make sure you have the backend running first)
```bash
  npm run dev
```
